# VIRTUAL MACHINES

## virt-manager

There are multiple repo with same name on internet. The below project is getting update and it has `Flatpak` build:

<https://gitlab.com/virt-viewer/virt-viewer/>

After installation, the GUI shortcut has name: `Remote Viewer`.

## system session vs user session

`system session` is super admin. but `user session` is very limited. with `user session` you may have issues to create different network mapping or connecting USB or PCI devices.

## switch to "user session" on virt-manager

To see the same list from both GUI apps:

- Open `virt-manager` (without `sudo`)
- `add connection`
- `Hypervisor=QEMU/KVM user session`.

## config files

`Gnome-boxes`, `virt-manager`, `Cockpit` use common config files. For user session they use this directory:

```
/home/user1/.config/libvirt/qemu
```

## Permission to bind ISO or disk files on VM

Put everything inside proper folder:

- `User session`:

  ```
  /home/user1/.local/share/libvirt/images
  ```

- `System session`:

  ```
  /var/lib/libvirt/images
  ```

All storage information can be found here:

- `Cockpit`
- `Virtual machines`
- `Storage pools`

It is good to use default directories because permission management is complex. Even if you give the ISO file `777` permission:

- the user and group should be compatible with VM initializer
- Also all the parent directories should have the correct permissions.

## vm name

As "VM name", `Gnome-boxes` use different variable inside XML (if UI-app don't find name field (inside XML) he want, it use XML file name for "VM name").

## Cockpit

`virt-manager` is not developing anymore. `Cockpit` is the successor. it has web based UI.

(try to install `flatpak` only. if its not enough, then install via `DNF`)

```sh
sudo dnf install cockpit

sudo systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket
```

Then go from web browser and log-in via OS username and password:

> https://localhost:9090

As default, `Cockpit` does not include UI modules for virtual machines. You install it from:

- `Web UI` --> `Applications` --> `machines` --> `Install` (you don't need restart. `Virtual machines` menu will be added automatically to web-UI.)

## Connect to desktop

`Gnome-boxes` can not connect to `Cockpit`-created VM (limited feature or a bug). But with `Remmina` you can connect it. To connect a USB device always use `Cockpit` (But it requires `system session` VM).

`Cockpit` shows how any 3rd party client can connect to desktop via IP and port. It shows under `Virtual machine` -> `Console` -> `Desktop viewer`. It shows both `Spice` and `VNC` protocols. With `Remmina` you can connect both (test by me), but `Spice` is faster than `VNC`.

`Remmina` shows many options:

- `SPICE` (this is the fastest)
- `VNC` plugin for `Gnome` and `KVM`. (it works but it's slow)
- others...

## create VM with specific disk format

When an image is imported to `gnome-boxes`, `gnome-boxes` converts this image to `qcow2`. But `Virt-manager` can run other image formats without any conversion. Therefore, create the VM from `virt-manager` and run it from `gnome-boxes` if you will use the built-in share feature of `gnome-boxes`.

## File share tips

### 1- adding ISO as CD-ROM hardware

```sh
mkisofs -o '/dir1/shared_files.iso' '/dir1/shared_files'
```

`7zip`, `Peazip` does not create ISO.

Use "`Cdrtfe`" (via `portableapps.com`) on `Windows` to create ISO.

### 2- gnome-boxes drag-drop

### 3- syncthing

For 2nd and 3rd options, the network of VM must be `bridge`. When the `bridge` network is selected from `virt-manager` GUI, the device name must be `virbr0`.

### 4- pairdrop

## VirtualBox içerisinde Resolution ayarlama

Çözünürlük ilk makina kurulduğunda küçük gelir. Arttırabilmek için:

- "`guest additions`" eklentisi ziyaretçi makinaya kurulmalıdır.
- guest restart edilir. 
- Artık `Virtualbox` --> `görünüm` --> `"misafir ekranını otomatik yeniden boyutlandır`" seçeneği, anlık olarak guest OS'un `VirtualBox` penceresini kaplayacak şekilde genişlemesini sağlamaktadır.

## virt-manager içerisinde Resolution ayarlama

direk olarak masaüstü görüntü ayarları genişletilebilir. ek bir ayara gerek yok.

## Microsoft Licence

## Windows 10 Licence

windows activate edilmediğinde sistem kullanılabiliyor. Sadece şunlar kısıtlanıyor:

- sync with account
- theme and personalizations
- optional updates (critical and security updates are installing)

## Windows 11 PRO VS HOME

`Home` version does not include features like:

- `Hyper-V`.
- `Windows containers` (`Home` version can only run Linux containers) (source: <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/>)

In any case the `PRO` version should be preferred.

## Office Licence

`Office` without licence only allows you to open files read-only.

If you need `Office` only once, mount `office-2021-pro-plus.iso` as `CD-ROM` to VM, and install it. It allows you to use all features for 5 days. The setup process takes about 6 minutes on `SSD` drive. The `windows10-VM` increases to `15.4` GB.

## Notes for Windows

- There is no need to disable `fast-startup` on VM (because its disabled by default).
- If any error shows with code `OOBEZDP`, click many times `skip` or `try-again`. It will skip that step.
- To change the Windows resolution inside VM, download the `guest` package and install on Windows from: <https://www.spice-space.org/download.html>
- To skip user cloud account:
  - on the `Choose a country` screen, press the `Shift + F10`.
  - it will open terminal.
  - type `OOBE/BYPASSNRO` press `enter`.
  - it will restart automatically.
  - then on the new screens do not choose personal account. choose `school` or `work` account. And then `sign-in options` --> `domain join instead`.
