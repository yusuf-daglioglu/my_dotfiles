# APP CRITERIA

- wayland support (because of security and unexpected-exit bug on Fedora)

- cross platform (windows , mac, linux)

- formats with official packages:

  - if critical app --> appimage is important (because I store them on USB)
  
  - others --> flatpak is important (because it gets auto updates) (because home folder stays clean)

  - check if other formats available: standalone for windows, nix, snap, dnf

- check if it works optionally offline (for example if it is dictionary, does it work offline if internet is not available)

- on issue tracker search for:  "privacy", "security" keywords. also check without any keyword the below combinations:

  - closed & non closed issues
  
  - latest & most commented issues & top rated issues

- search what they said about that app on duckduckgo and "privacyguides.org" (Lemmy, Github issues and Discuss) (if not asked before ask it on "privacyguides.org")

- "privacyguides.org" has "Criteria" section for each type(group) of application. check them all.

- contributor distribution (how many contributors really help for coding - eliminate the translators)

- if both privacy-policy and license documents exist

- check alternativeto.net

- check for command line alternatives. maybe only some features enough for me. I may not need all UI features.

- check github forks from github-active-fork-finder.

- check readme, wiki for base technologies and programming languages (they also must open-source - do not prefer languages like C#)

- if you find multiple apps, add them all to "my_dot_files" in a separate group (in case any one not work, I can use the other one).

- export and import user settings should be easy and human-readable and profile-management should be easy (like supports both GUI and command line)

- for web site(page) only service (this sub-title checklist should be considered also for desktop-app's official web site)

  - all items above (if logical)

  - if it has a web site without advertisements

  - if it works on Tor Browser on Linux Desktop and Android.

  - if it works on hardened-Firefox with ublock-origin enabled on Linux Desktop and Android.

- for android apps

  - all items above (if logical)

  - check if it has less permissions
  
  - check if it is on f-droid. (other markets like google-play is advantage because also companies check security issues and blocks spammers)
  
  - check the f-droid for issues (it shows if they use bad dependencies)

- for firefox extensions

  - all items above (if logical)

  - check if it has less permissions
  
  - prefer if it is available as filter for ublock-origin (like paywall)
  
  - check if it available on firefox-addon-store (also Firefox checks security issues and blocks spammers)
