# MINIMUM HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

## Android Emulator

<https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator#requirements>

- For extra speed with acceleration
  
  <https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration>

  - Intel Processors with Intel Virtualization Technology (VT-x) (HAXM is the old generation technology of VT-d)
  - AMD Processors with AMD-V (SVM)
  - Apple silicon M1 and M2 families

- Second-level address translation (SLAT). Named on each brand:
  - for Intel --> EPT
  - for AMD --> RVI

## General notes for Android Emulator acceleration (this is not requirement)

if accelerated emulator running, you can not:

- run another app which requires virtualization technology.
- run accelerated emulator inside a VM.

## Windows 11

<https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11-system-requirements-86c11283-ea52-4782-9efd-7674389a7ba3>

- DirectX 12 support of GPU
- optional (requires manuel action on installation)
  - UEFI with secure boot
  - Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0

## Windows 11 hyper-v

- Hardware-enforced Data Execution Prevention (DEP)

  Name for each brand:
  - For Intel --> XD bit (execute disable bit).
  - For AMD --> NX bit (no execute bit).

- Only for SR-IOV feature:

  - Extended Page Table (EPT) or AMD's Nested Page Table (NPT)

  - The chipset must have:

    - Interrupt remapping - Intel's VT-d with the Interrupt Remapping capability (VT-d2) or any version of AMD I/O Memory Management Unit (I/O MMU).

      (HAXM is the old generation technology of VT-d)

    - DMA remapping - Intel's VT-d with Queued Invalidations or any AMD I/O MMU.

    - Access control services (ACS) on PCI Express root ports.

- Only for Shielded virtual machines feature:

  - UEFI 2.3.1c
  - TPM v2.0
  - IOMMU (Intel VT-D)

## Android Studio

<https://developer.android.com/studio/install>
