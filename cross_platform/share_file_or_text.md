Notes:

- Do not use `SnapDrop`. It owned by a company.

- `Send (old-name: Firefox Send)` public instances: <https://github.com/timvisee/send-instances?tab=readme-ov-file#instances>

- Use `SimpleX` as note taking app. because it creates separate users for mobile and desktop. so if one of them corrupts, you can still use other device as backup.

- `Syncthing` official Android client has been abandoned. This is a new fork of it: <https://github.com/Catfriend1/syncthing-android>
