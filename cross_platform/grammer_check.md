# GRAMER CHECK

## Google Translate

Suggests fixes for wrong words. But the copied text should be maximum 20-30 words. Otherwise it does not work properly.

## LibreOffice

<https://extensions.libreoffice.org/en/extensions/show/languagetool?commentsstart193=10>

This extension is open source. It supports Greek, English and other languages (but not Turkish).

You should change current page content language from: LibreOffice settings --> `Language settings` --> `Languages` --> `Default language for documents` --> "`Western`" value should be set.

Some languages on the list have an icon on the left side. That means the extension or LibreOffice embedded features support that language for spell check.

## Firefox

<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/language-tools/>

In above link "`Language Packs`" are addons to change browser UI. But "`Dictionaries`" are add-ons for gramer checking.

To enable specific language on a HTML-textarea element: right click on textarea, and choose "languages".

## gnome-text-editor

Gnome default text editor checks gramer by default. For different languages right click on app and choose "language".
