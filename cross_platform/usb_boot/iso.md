# ISO

- `fedora Workstation`
  
  1- for daily use. because:
  - privacyguides.org easiest recommendation for end-user.
  - Gnome comes pure as possible.

  2- run `Flatpak` apps via live-OS (normally `Flatpak` may require restart or config which is not possible on live-OS).

- `gparted live OS`

  AFAIK there is no "gparted GUI" is included any other distro on my list. In case any offline environment I may need this app. (even if exist this is extremely minimal OS which can start on every machine)

- `MX Linux Fluxbox`

  MX Linux has extra features even on live-OS:
  - some extra codecs and apps like VLC.
  - Automatic enabling of most Broadcom drivers
  - Increased support for realtek wifi devices
  - antiX (support for old and limited resource hardwares) live system

- `mx linux KDE`

  Fluxbox is very light, but KDE offers more integration tools (like bluetooth, multi-monitor) on desktop environment.

- `tails`

  Run any app via `tor`:

- `Ubuntu`

  1- it has largest market share. so an app may only work on this.

  2- run `Snap` apps via live-OS (normally `Snap` may require restart or config which is not possible on live-OS).

- `windows 11`

  personal computer installation.
