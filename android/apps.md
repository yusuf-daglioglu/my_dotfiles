## SCREEN BUTTON UTILITIES

### Screenshot Tile (NoRoot) (com.github.cvzi.screenshottile)

takes screenshots with 3 seconds delay.

### Volume Control (com.punksta.apps.volumecontrol)

- it opens it's own window and shows each volume source separately. If OEM device has set any volume source with another, this app will change whole depended volume sources automatically. So you can check which source are separated by OEM(device). for example "ringer volume" and "notification volume" sources can not be different.
- Has volume profiles on notification bar

### Lock (name.seguri.android.lock)

- locks screen with desktop button.
- Install this app, only if you can not find any feature embedded on system with those keywords: "Double-Tap to Lock and Unlock Android".

</br></br></br>

## FILE MANAGERS

### MaterialFiles

<https://github.com/zhanghai/MaterialFiles>

Includes FTP Server feature.

Notes:

- `Gnome Nautilus` has embedded ftp-client. but secure ftp (ftps) is buggy. you should
  - always use username and password!
  - VPN must be fully excluded.
- for long file names enable the "marquee". the animation works very fast enough.
- use the read-only feature on FTP if possible

### SimpleMobileTools / Simple-File-Manager

Better for long file names (font size can be decreased). THIS HAS PRIVACY ISSUES. DO NOT INSTALL IT.

### OS embedded file manager

it can be used as default. it is mostly faster and bug-free.

- `Fennec F-droid`

  - listed on f-droid.

- `tor browser`

- recommended by `privacy-guides`:
  - `Brave`
  - `cromite`

### Other notes for browsers

- `Ankerfox-user-js` (with my personel customizations) does not have any important except "`strict protection`" which can be enabled from GUI. Therefore if any browser will discontinued, `Mozilla Firefox` (official build) can be used.

## PDF Readers

- <https://gitlab.com/mudlej_android/mj_pdf_reader>
- `MuPDF`

do not use:

- `Secure PDF Viewer` <https://github.com/GrapheneOS/PdfViewer> is based on `chromium`.
- can not use `firefox` built-in. because `firefox` does not open local files.
